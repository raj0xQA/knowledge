                    <div class="specs">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Smartphones:</strong> Approximately 6-8 full charges (based on a 3,500mAh phone battery)</li>
                            <li><strong>Tablets:</strong> 2-3 full charges (based on a 10,000mAh tablet battery)</li>
                            <li><strong>Laptops:</strong> 1-1.5 charges for most ultrabooks (based on a 60Wh laptop battery)</li>
                            <li><strong>Action Cameras:</strong> Up to 15 charges (based on a 1,700mAh camera battery)</li>
                            <li><strong>Wireless Earbuds:</strong> Up to 30 charges (based on a 500mAh charging case)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>The actual number of charges may vary based on device battery health, age, charging efficiency (approximately 85-90% for our power bank), and environmental conditions. The battery utilizes premium cells with a cycle life of over 500 complete charge-discharge cycles before capacity drops to 80% of original specification.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <!-- FAQ 2 -->
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">2. How effective is the solar charging, and how long does it take to fully charge via sunlight?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The EcoCharge Pro features a high-efficiency monocrystalline solar panel with 24% conversion efficiency (industry average is 15-20%). The panel is rated at 10W under ideal sunlight conditions (1,000 W/m² solar irradiance at 25°C).</p>
                    <p><strong>Solar Charging Times:</strong></p>
                    <div class="specs">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ideal Conditions:</strong> 18-24 hours of direct, unobstructed sunlight for a full charge</li>
                            <li><strong>Average Outdoor Conditions:</strong> 30-40 hours of mixed sun exposure</li>
                            <li><strong>Emergency Partial Charge:</strong> 2-3 hours of sunlight provides approximately 20% charge (enough for 1-2 smartphone charges)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>For optimal solar charging, position the panel at a 90-degree angle to the sun's rays, avoid shading, and clean the solar surface regularly. The solar panel includes a PET polymer protective layer that is scratch-resistant and UV-protected. Solar charging is intended primarily as an emergency or supplementary power source rather than primary charging method. For regular use, we recommend charging via the included wall adapter (full charge in 6-8 hours) or a compatible USB-C PD charger (full charge in 4-5 hours).</p>

                    <p>To check battery level, briefly press the power button. The LEDs will illuminate for 5 seconds showing current charge level. For a more precise reading, you can connect the power bank to the EcoCharge mobile app (available for iOS and Android) which shows exact percentage, estimated time remaining for charging/discharging, input/output wattage, and battery health metrics. The power bank also features an auto-off function that powers down the unit after 30 seconds if no device is connected, conserving battery life. A long press (3 seconds) of the power button activates emergency flashlight mode (the power bank includes a 100-lumen LED flashlight with SOS strobe function).</p>

            <!-- FAQ 8 -->
            <div class="faq-question">8. Can I charge the EcoCharge Pro while simultaneously charging devices from it?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, the EcoCharge Pro supports pass-through charging (also called bypass charging). This feature allows you to charge the power bank itself while simultaneously using it to charge other devices. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you have limited access to power outlets.</p>
                    <div class="specs">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Input Priority:</strong> When connected to both an input source (solar/wall/car charger) and output devices, the power bank intelligently allocates power with priority given to charging connected devices first, then charging its internal battery with any remaining power.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maximum Combined Output:</strong> When using pass-through charging, the total output to connected devices is limited to 15W to ensure safe operation and prevent overheating.</li>
                            <li><strong>Supported Scenarios:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Charging from solar while charging your phone</li>
                                    <li>Charging from a wall outlet while charging a tablet and smartphone simultaneously</li>
                                    <li>Charging from a car adapter while running a portable fan and charging a GPS device</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Important considerations for pass-through charging: 1) Use the included 18W charger or equivalent for optimal performance. 2) Total heat generation will be higher during pass-through operation - ensure adequate ventilation. 3) Charging efficiency in pass-through mode is approximately 75-80% compared to 85-90% in normal operation. 4) When charging from solar while simultaneously powering devices, available solar input may be insufficient to both power devices and charge the internal battery - in low-light conditions, the power bank may discharge slowly even while connected to solar.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">9. What is the shelf life and self-discharge rate of the EcoCharge Pro when not in use?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The EcoCharge Pro has been engineered for minimal self-discharge and long shelf life, making it ideal for emergency kits and occasional use scenarios.</p>
                    <div class="specs">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Self-Discharge Rate:</strong> Approximately 3-5% per month when stored at room temperature (20-25°C / 68-77°F)</li>
                            <li><strong>Optimal Storage Charge Level:</strong> 60-80% for long-term storage (the power bank includes a "Storage Mode" activated by holding both volume buttons for 5 seconds, which discharges/charges to optimal 70% level)</li>
                            <li><strong>Shelf Life:</strong> The lithium-polymer cells maintain >80% of original capacity after 3 years of proper storage</li>
                            <li><strong>Storage Temperature Range:</strong> -20°C to 45°C (-4°F to 113°F) for non-operational storage</li>
                            <li><strong>Battery Preservation Features:</strong>
                                <ul>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>For emergency preparedness applications, we recommend checking the power bank every 6 months and topping up the charge if below 50%. The power bank includes a built-in calendar function (maintained by a small separate capacitor) that tracks storage time and will flash the battery indicator in a specific pattern if it has been stored for more than 12 months without use, indicating it should be fully cycled (charged to 100% then discharged to 20% and recharged to 70%) to maintain battery health. Avoid storing the power bank in fully charged (100%) or fully discharged (0%) states for extended periods as this accelerates capacity degradation.</p>
